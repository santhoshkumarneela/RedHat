###DNS SERVER CONFIGURATION RHEL6###

1.Make hostname, IPADDRESS , GATEWAY PERMANENT
# cat ifcfg-eth0
DEVICE="eth0"
BOOTPROTO="static"
HWADDR="00:0C:29:2A:FD:11"
ONBOOT="yes"
USERCTL=no
IPADDR=192.168.0.100
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
GATEWAY=192.168.0.1
DNS1=192.168.0.100
# cat /etc/sysconfig/network
NETWORKING=yes
HOSTNAME=linuxprod.training.com
GATEWAY=192.168.0.1

2.Add entry in /etc/hosts
# cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomai          n4
::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomai          n6
192.168.0.100 linuxprod.train.com  linuxprod

3.Add entry in /etc/resolv.conf
# cat /etc/resolv.conf
search linux-prod.train.com
nameserver 192.168.0.100

4.Restart Network services
#service network restart

5.Now install bind  packages
#yum install bind-*


6.Take backup of /etc/named.conf
#cp /etc/named.conf /etc/named.conf.bkp

7.Now modify /etc/named.conf and find difference
listen-on port 53 { 192.168.0.100; };
allow-query     { any; };

#diff /etc/named.conf /etc/named.conf.bkp
11c11
<       listen-on port 53 { 192.168.0.100; };
---
>       listen-on port 53 { 127.0.0.1; };
17c17
<       allow-query     { any; };
---
>       allow-query     { localhost; };

8.Now modify /etc/named.rfc1912.zones
#cp /etc/named.rfc1912.zones /etc/named.rfc1912.zones.bkp
zone "train.com" IN {
        type master;
        file "forward.zone";
        allow-update { none; };
zone "0.168.192.in-addr.arpa" IN {
        type master;
        file "reverse.zone";
        allow-update { none; };


diff /etc/named.rfc1912.zones /etc/named.rfc1912.zones.bkp
13c13
< zone "train.com" IN {
---
> zone "localhost.localdomain" IN {
15c15
<       file "forward.zone";
---
>       file "named.localhost";
31c31
< zone "0.168.192.in-addr.arpa" IN {
---
> zone "1.0.0.127.in-addr.arpa" IN {
33c33
<       file "reverse.zone";
---
>       file "named.loopback";

9.Now create forward.zone & reverse.zone files from localhost&loopback
cp -p named.localhost forward.zone
cp -p named.loopback reverse.zone
cp forward.zone forward.zone.bkp
cp reverse.zone reverse.zone.bkp
Now modify forward.zone & reverse.zone
#diff forward.zone forward.zone.bkp
2,3c2
< @     IN SOA  linux-prod.train.com. root.linux-prod.train.com. (
<
---
> @     IN SOA  @ rname.invalid. (
9,10c8,10
<       IN NS   linux-prod.train.com.
< linux-prod    IN A    192.168.0.100
---
>       NS      @
>       A       127.0.0.1
>       AAAA    ::1

#diff reverse.zone reverse.zone.bkp
2c2
< @     IN SOA  linux-prod.train.com.   root.linux-prod.train.com. (
---
> @     IN SOA  @ rname.invalid. (
8,9c8,11
<       IN NS   linux-prod.train.com.
< 100   IN PTR  linux-prod.train.com.
---
>       NS      @
>       A       127.0.0.1
>       AAAA    ::1
>       PTR     localhost.

Now test the forward.zone & reverse.zone
[root@linux-prod named]# named-checkzone train.com forward.zone
zone train.com/IN: loaded serial 0
OK
[root@linux-prod named]# named-checkzone train.com reverse.zone
zone train.zone/IN: loaded serial 0
OK


10.Now start Named service
#service named start

11.Now verify with 
#dig linux-prod.train.com
#dig -x 192.168.0.100
#nslookup linux-prod.train.com
#nslookup 192.168.0.100


Technical Terms
####A start of authority (SOA) record is information stored in a domain name system (DNS) 
zone about that zone and about other DNS records. 
A DNS zone is the part of a domain for which an individual DNS server is responsible. 
Each zone contains a single SOA record.

####NS records specify the servers which are providing DNS services for that domain name. 
The A records point host names (such as www, ftp, mail) to one or more IP addresses. 
It is important to have both NS and A record in zone if you need to delegate 
sub-zone to different 
DNS server

##PTR###POINTER RECORDs
You can think of the PTR record as an opposite of the A record. 
While the A record points a domain name to an IP address, 
the PTR record resolves the IP address to a domain/hostname. 
PTR records are used for the reverse DNS (Domain Name System) lookup.
