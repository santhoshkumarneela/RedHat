Introduction
Bonding (or channel bonding) is a technology enabled by the Linux kernal and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, 
that allows administrators to combine two or more network interfaces to form a single, logical "bonded" 
interface for redundancy or increased throughput. The behavior of the bonded interfaces depends upon the mode; 
generally speaking, modes provide either hot standby or load balancing services. Additionally, they may provide l
ink-integrity monitoring.

This article describes the configuration methods of bonding on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, Red Hat Enterprise Linux  4 
and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.


Configuring bonded devices on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5
Single bonded device on RHEL5

1.Add 2 NIC's to the Server ex eth0 & eth1
#dmesg | grep eth
#ethtool eth0
#ethtool eth2
Above commands we need to check "Link detected yes"

2.To configure the bond0 device with the network interface eth0 and eth1, perform the following steps:
  a.Add the following line to /etc/modprobe.conf:
   alias bond0 bonding
  b.Create the channel bonding interface file  ifcfg-bond0 in the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ directory:
# cat /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-bond0
DEVICE=bond0
IPADDR=192.168.0.100
NETMASK=255.255.255.0
USERCTL=no
BOOTPROTO=none
ONBOOT=yes
BONDING_OPTS="mode=0 miimon=100"
#BONDING_OPTS="miimon=100 mode=balance-tlb"

Note:
*Configure the bonding parameters in the file /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-bond0, 
as above, BONDING_OPTS="mode=0 miimon=100".
*       The behavior of the bonded interfaces depends upon the mode. 
The mode 0 is the default value, which causes bonding to set all slaves of an active-backup bond 
to the same MAC address at enslavement time. For more information about the bonding modes, 
refer to The bonding modes supported in Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

4.Configure the ethernet interface in the file /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0.  
Both eth0 and eth1 should look like the following example:

DEVICE=eth0
BOOTPROTO=none
#HWADDR=00:0c:29:5b:61:ac
ONBOOT=yes
MASTER=bond0
SLAVE=yes
USERCTL=no

DEVICE=eth2
BOOTPROTO=none
#HWADDR=00:0c:29:5b:61:b6
ONBOOT=yes
MASTER=bond0
SLAVE=yes
USERCTL=no

/etc/modprobe.conf -redhat 5
/etc/modprobe.d/bonding.conf- redhat 6

Note:
*Replace <N> with the numerical value for the interface, such as 0 and 1 in this example. 
Replace the HWADDR value with the MAC for the interface.
*       Red Hat suggest that configure the MAC address of the ethernet card into the file 
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth<N>.

4.Restart the network service:
#service network restart

5.Test bonding now
#ifconfig -a
#ping <ip>
5.In order to check the bonding status, check the following file:
# cat /proc/net/bonding/bond0
# cat /sys/class/net/bond0/bonding/mode
# cat /etc/modprobe.d/bonding.conf
